# AquaMonitor: Real-time, Bilingual Water Safety Monitoring

## 🌊 The Problem
Traditional water testing is slow, expensive, and manual. Contamination often goes undetected for weeks, leading to serious health risks. This "Dangerous Delay" means communities consume unsafe water simply because they don't know it's dirty in time.

## 💡 The Solution
AquaMonitor is a low-cost IoT solution that provides 24/7 analysis of water quality.
- Continuous Monitoring: Real-time data on pH, Turbidity, and TDS.
- Smart Analytics:A "Danger Score" algorithm based on WHO standards.
- Bilingual Alerts: Immediate safety status and health advice in English and Hindi.
- Hybrid System:Supports both IoT sensor automation and manual data entry.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Hardware: ESP32, pH Sensor, Turbidity Sensor, TDS Sensor.
- Google Technologies: AI Studio (Backend development), Gemini (Planning), NotebookLM (Infographics).

## 🚀 Key Features
- Real-time Dashboard: Visual color-coded status (Green/Yellow/Red).
- Inclusivity: Designed for non-technical users with local language support.
- Scalability: Built with accessible components for widespread deployment.
